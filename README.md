# CRUD App using Hasura and React
 _This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Hasura and React. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete records in a database table._

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run npm install or yarn install to install the dependencies.
Configuration
Configure the Hasura endpoint URL and admin secret in the .env file. If you don't have a Hasura endpoint set up, you can create one for free at https://hasura.io.

## Usage
Run npm start or yarn start to start the development server.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
Once the app is running, you can use it to create, view, update, and delete records in the database table. The app uses GraphQL queries and mutations to interact with the Hasura API, and updates the UI in real-time using React state and hooks.
